In order to update the docker image that travis builds at each run, simply modify create_wheel.dockerfile.
NB: no need to upload a new image to docker hub!

When modifying the base image (manylinux), you have to upload a new docker image to docker hub.

In the root dir of Bohrium download and unpack:

    cuda_8.0.44_linux.run
    <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-download-archive>

Then run:

    sudo docker build -t bohrium/manylinux:latest -f package/docker/manylinux.dockerfile .
    sudo docker login
    sudo docker push bohrium/manylinux:latest

Note, before pushing you might want to squash the image <https://github.com/jwilder/docker-squash>.
