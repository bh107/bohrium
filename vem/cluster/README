This is the pseudocode for the mapping function



#Split the operands of an instruction into chunks such that each chunk are located on a single process. Since there is no conflict within an instruction we can apply the instruction on each set of chunks and get the same result the original instruction.

def chunks(operands[], start_coord=(0,...,0), end_coord=(infinity,...,infinity)):

    shape = (infinity,...,infinity)
    starts[]
    for op in operands:
        #Compute the global start offset
        start = sum_{i=0}(start_coord[i] * op->stride[i])
        #Compute the size of the local part of the global array
        localsize = totalsize / number of processes
        #Compute process rank
        rank = start / localsize
        #Convert the global start to the local start offset
        start -= rank * localsize
        starts.append(start)

        #Find the largest possible shape that fits this process
        offset = 0

            shape[d] = min(size, end_coord[d] - start_coord[d], shape[d])
        
    chunks[] = A new copy of each operand with the new common shape and their respective calculated start offsets
